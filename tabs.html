	  <p>The Melton Foundation was recently invited to participate in the Nexus Global Youth Summit held at the U.N Headquarters in New York, from 20th-22nd July. 
	  It was a great honour for us to be selected to the Nexus Summit and this certainly did support the efforts to build visibility and help put Melton on the map. </p>
		<p>Nexus is a global movement which seeks to bridge communities of wealth and social entrepreneurship (enterprises). 
		With thousands of members from over 70 countries, Nexus work to unite young investors, social entrepreneurs, philanthropists and 
		allies to catalyze new leadership and accelerate global solutions. 
		Founded in 2011, Nexus has hosted over 20 summits across six continents to connect young people from diverse 
		backgrounds and link communities that would otherwise never meet. Nexus also conducts research and provides thought leadership 
		to facilitate collaboration and build a global culture of philanthropy.</p>
		<p>On 20th of July,  2016 , we set foot into Nexus, to get inspired and build collaborations.

		<p>We ( Winthrop, Beryl and I ) got to the New School, 
		NYC at 2pm and attended a session on 'Pushing Boundaries through film and media' where we experienced 
		the actual situation of Syrian Refugees through Virtual Reality. 
		We also interacted first hand with 8-10 social impact companies that use VR, media, and audio-video to bring about change.  
		Some of these were,  'Gasland',  'FlyByLight',  'IAmEvidence' and so on.  
We brainstormed ideas on how we can all collaborate to improve ways to bring impact. </p>
 <img src="divider2.png">
	<h3>At 5 pm</h3>
	<p>Victor and Gaurav joined us and we headed to the Inaugural,  NEW TO NEXUS session. At New to Nexus,  
	we were introduced to the Nexus family,  what kind of engagements Nexus has,  and what we can expect for the next couple of days.  
	We then headed to a Wine and cheese reception, and then the Plenary session. </p>
	 <img src="divider2.png">
	<h3>Speakers at the Plenary: </h3>
	<p>This Plenary session had possibly the most insightful, inspiring and young innovators we had seen.  
	From Yeonmi Park who escaped from North Korea, and the 13 year old genius-inventor Max Loughan,  we were spellbound at the end of it all.
</p>
<p>After exchanging cards and brainstorming about MF's involvement with some of these companies, 
there was the Climate Change Working Group Dinner – 
an informal meet to discuss climate based projects by all interested Summit participants.	</p>

		<p>The second day of the summit was less listening, and a lot more doing. We were involved with interactive working groups,
		other fellowships, and speakers all day and also attended workshops that basically changed the way I think. 
		The day was called ‘Big Ideas for a Better World’ and it started with a performance by Christen Lien. </p>
		<p>We had the CEO of Atlas Corps talk about his fellowship institute and how they function. 
		After this, we had discussions about mental health, Moral leadership, Global Citizenship ( we got to meet Hugh Evans –
		CEO, Global Citizen ) and Equal Justice. </p>
		<p>We then broke into working groups and went ahead to different sessions. 
		These sessions were where attendees put ideas on the table about ‘How Change Makers Start’, ‘Impact Investing’, 
		‘Networking across boundaries’ to name a few. </p>
		<p>The day came to an end with a brilliant ‘prototyping workshop’ that taught us crisis management and problem solving.</p>
		<p>Some of the people we met there are remarkable and we hope that both the Melton Network and them can benefit from our relationship.</p>

		<p>We had Pulitzer Prize winning journalists, technical geniuses, UN staff, and global youth activists in the room to address us.</p>

		<p>The Nexus Summit came to an end with tears and hugs and lessons and laughter. 
		At Nexus, not only did they teach us how to network and collaborate, but they taught us that we would all have to work together. </p>
		<p>On the first day of the summit everyone kept saying to each other that they ‘had each other’s back’. 
		By the time the summit ended, I knew they all meant it. This summit is going to bring some great opportunities to Melton and

	<p>This event was part one of the three Pre GCC activities based on the themes of
	the GCC 2016 to be held in Temuco, Chile. Fellows gathered at a JF’s house and
	participated in the activity. We discussed the various facets of Indian culture
	and how we could showcase it at the GCC. Akshay Nelakurti led us through the
	activity and asked our opinions about Indian culture. We spoke about many
	ideas and how we could go about portraying them. We decided to put up
	stalls, four in number, one each for food, clothing, architecture and arts, from
	various parts of India. We plan to do this through display of pictures.</p>

  <h3><u>GENDER EMPOWERMENT – JULY 12</u><sup>th</sup></h3>
	<p>In our second pre GCC activity, we watched a TED talk by Adithi Gupta about
menstruation being a taboo in India. As Adithi went on to explain how she was
forced to use rags as sanitary napkins and how certain religious beliefs in India
are binding and rigorous, the Fellows were astounded by the sheer amount of
ignorance.</p>
<p>The Fellows were then asked to write their initial thoughts after watching the
video. A flurry of thoughts, ranging from how a comic strip could effectively be
used to challenge societal norms, to the courage of a woman like Adithi to
stand up for millions of girls, came up. The Fellows then wrote down 5 words
from the talk that stood out to them which was followed by a discussion of
experiences they've had, growing up with customs and gender based
discrimination in India.</p>
<p>The evening was then concluded, with everyone leaving the room with more
open, enlightened minds.</p>

  <h3><u>SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES – AUGUST 1</u><sup>st</sup></h3>
	<p>As part of the third Pre GCC activity, we first watched a TED talk which
highlights the amount of waste generated by people from various parts of the
world and how this contributes to our carbon footprint, affects economy and
how it gives rise to unhealthy, costly lifestyle. The video gave us an insight into
how these bad conditions affected the speaker and how she went on to
inculcating a sustainable lifestyle by reducing the amount of trash everyday
and finally a message to viewers which appealed at following at least some of
the discussed methods and paying a little more attention towards what we
buy, use and discard.</p>
<p>As part of the activity we all deliberated on the various sustainable methods
we could implement, why they are effective and how important it is to impart
the message and inform people about the importance of sustainability. We
each took a sheet of paper and wrote down a few things which we purchased
which contained plastic and a few others which didn’t and then discussed
about how we could reduce the former. And later, we all decided upon
extending this activity to a few other people and compare the listings and
discuss the pros and cons of the same.</p>

	setting up a wireless printer. Can you see the gap? Human-

	analyze, from a critical perspective,scenarios of precariousness
	where resistant communities develop new knowledge and skills to
	transform their realities. Then we will explore how some
	methodologiesthat are typically used by social scientist can be useful
	for engineers, who want to engage local communitiesin the
