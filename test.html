	<h3><u>CULTURES IN A GLOBALIZED WORLD – MAY 21</u><sup>st</sup></h3>
	<p>This event was part one of the three Pre GCC activities based on the themes of
	the GCC 2016 to be held in Temuco, Chile. Fellows gathered at a JF’s house and
	participated in the activity. We discussed the various facets of Indian culture
	and how we could showcase it at the GCC. Akshay Nelakurti led us through the
	activity and asked our opinions about Indian culture. We spoke about many
	ideas and how we could go about portraying them. We decided to put up
	stalls, four in number, one each for food, clothing, architecture and arts, from
	various parts of India. We plan to do this through display of pictures.</p>

  <h3><u>GENDER EMPOWERMENT – JULY 12</u><sup>th</sup></h3>
	<p>In our second pre GCC activity, we watched a TED talk by Adithi Gupta about
menstruation being a taboo in India. As Adithi went on to explain how she was
forced to use rags as sanitary napkins and how certain religious beliefs in India
are binding and rigorous, the Fellows were astounded by the sheer amount of
ignorance.</p>
<p>The Fellows were then asked to write their initial thoughts after watching the
video. A flurry of thoughts, ranging from how a comic strip could effectively be
used to challenge societal norms, to the courage of a woman like Adithi to
stand up for millions of girls, came up. The Fellows then wrote down 5 words
from the talk that stood out to them which was followed by a discussion of
experiences they've had, growing up with customs and gender based
discrimination in India.</p>
<p>The evening was then concluded, with everyone leaving the room with more
open, enlightened minds.</p>

  <h3><u>SUSTAINABLE ECONOMIES – AUGUST 1</u><sup>st</sup></h3>
	<p>As part of the third Pre GCC activity, we first watched a TED talk which
highlights the amount of waste generated by people from various parts of the
world and how this contributes to our carbon footprint, affects economy and
how it gives rise to unhealthy, costly lifestyle. The video gave us an insight into
how these bad conditions affected the speaker and how she went on to
inculcating a sustainable lifestyle by reducing the amount of trash everyday
and finally a message to viewers which appealed at following at least some of
the discussed methods and paying a little more attention towards what we
buy, use and discard.</p>
<p>As part of the activity we all deliberated on the various sustainable methods
we could implement, why they are effective and how important it is to impart
the message and inform people about the importance of sustainability. We
each took a sheet of paper and wrote down a few things which we purchased
which contained plastic and a few others which didn’t and then discussed
about how we could reduce the former. And later, we all decided upon
extending this activity to a few other people and compare the listings and
discuss the pros and cons of the same.</p>
